# FIM-Using-Wazuh
# üß† Introduction to EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- **EDR refers to tools that monitor, record, and analyze activities on endpoints (servers, desktops, laptops) to detect malicious behavior, help in incident response, and enable threat hunting.**

# üîé How Does a SOC Analyst Use EDR?

 SOC Analysts rely on EDR tools to:
  
- **Detect suspicious behaviors (e.g., process injection, lateral movement)**
- **Investigate alerts and correlate activity over time**
- **Isolate or respond to infected endpoints**
- **Pull forensic artifacts like logs, memory dumps, and timelines.**
- **Hunt for threat indicators (IOCs)**

# üõ°Ô∏è Wazuh?
- **Wazuh is a free and open-source security tool that acts like a smart security guard for your computers and servers. It helps you monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats by checking for unusual behavior, file changes, malware, and insecure settings.**
